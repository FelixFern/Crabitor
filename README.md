# 🦀 Crabitor

a Rust + React Markdown Editor, this project is my first ever writing in Rust so please excuse the badly written code 😅. 

You might be wondering why don't you write the Frontend in Rust too? the main reason is that I just want to build this project quickly without thinking that much on the UI side, that's why I build it with React with Shadcn even though it might not be as performant as building it using Rust with frameworks such as Leptos. 

Why is it named "Crabitor"? because it is Crab-itor, Crab and editor, get it? because it is written in Rust with a Crab icon. Yes, I'm very creative.

This project is started on April 17th, 2024, and is worked on in my spare time
